        <h2>Lucky</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't love a lab? They are loyal and very trainable. Lucky is no exception to the rule. </p>
        <p>If you want the ultimate sweet and unconditionally loving dog, then Lucky is the one for you! </p>
        <h2>Alex</h2>
        <p>Alex has no idea that he is tiny, and actually also has no idea that he's a dog. </p>
        <p>Not only does he love to ride in the car, but he's pretty sure he should be driving. This dog is hilarious. </p>
        <h2>Cassidy</h2>
        <p>Cassidy like to put her nose in your face. And she is quite a lover - so beware! </p>
        <p>If you don't like to be licked by a dog, then you don't want this dog. </p>

        <h2>More Information</h2>
        <p>Our agency puts a lot of care into finding the right homes for our dogs. </p>
        <p>There is nothing worse thank placing a dog, only to find that they are unhappy or they come back to us because owners did not get what they expected.</p>
        <p>Families seeking to adopt our dogs can expect to be thoroughly interviewed. We will also visit the dog in your home at random intervals during the first year. Further, you will need to visit the dog at our shelter 3 times before taking him or
            her home, and we will observe your interactions to ensure that you are a good fit for each other.</p>

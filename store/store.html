            <p>With Mojang merging into Microsoft, it was only a matter of time before Bill Gates started work on another game that he and Microsoft could put onto Xbox Game Pass. After Minecraft : Story Mode and Minceaft Dungeons showed promising results,

            <h4>Madden Infinite</h4>
            <p>Due purely to popular demand, EA sports has ben toying with the idea of releasing one edition of Madden that gets periodic updates to rosters and stats, so that patorns no longer need to purchase the game again every year. There are currently
                no plans to release this (no the surprise of nobody), but developers continue to update this channel so company employees (and you) can play for years to come!</p>

            <h4>Portal 3</h4>
            <p>Valve is back at it again! With Gabe Newell working on both Half-Life 3 and Portal 3 at the same time, it seems as if his creative juices have once again begun to flow. In this exciting new sequel, see how Chell deals with the new situations
                in Aperture Science laboratores and GLADoS's plans...</p>
